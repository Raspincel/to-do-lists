# to-do-lists
This program allows for the creation, visualization and deletion of lists. The items of each list can be marked with a red outline when completed, and when every item in a list is marked, the list itself gains a red outline to indicate it's conclusion. The intent of this program is to allow for the user to organize their chores and keep an eye on their progress, allowing for a sweet sensation of deleting a list full of completed items at the end.

This program was made with SFML as a form of practice, and it is far from being a top-tier one, but at least I could learn a lot while making it. It took me approximately 10 days to complete it, but I hope to complete similar tasks in a shorter time in the future.

That's all I had to say. Thanks for reading :)
